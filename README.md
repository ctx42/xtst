# Introduction to Ctx42 Testing Module

This repository marks the beginning of Ctx42 Testing Module, a collection of 
testing and assertion packages poised to help developers approach testing. As 
it develops, it will offer a comprehensive suite of tools designed to make 
testing more efficient, enjoyable, and integral to the development process.

Whether you're a seasoned tester or just starting out, tools in this module is 
being crafted to meet your needs, providing a solid foundation for ensuring 
code reliability in projects of all sizes.

## Simplicity and Usability

At the heart of the module lies a commitment to minimalism and an exceptional
developer experience (DX). By maintaining zero external dependencies, the
framework stays lightweight and fast, free from the potential complexities and
conflicts that third-party modules can introduce. Our documentation is being
carefully designed to be thorough, clear, and packed with practical examples,
empowering you to master the module with ease. Expect a great DX with features 
like a fluent, chainable API, descriptive error messages for quick debugging, 
all tailored to streamline your testing workflow.

## Modular and Extensible Design

`Xtst` is built as a collection of modular, laser-focused packages, each 
targeting a specific aspect of testing. For instance, you might leverage the 
`assert` package for assertions, the `mock` and `mocker` packages for test 
doubles, or the `tstkit` package to keep your tests readable and minimalistic. 
The modularity lets you customize your testing setup to fit your project’s 
exact needs, avoiding unnecessary overhead. Beyond customization, the 
extensible architecture invites you to create your own test helpers ensuring.

## Installation
To install Ctx42 Testing Module, use go get:

```shell
go get github.com/ctx42/testing
```

This will make all the package modules available to you.

## Packages

- Package [assert](pkg/assert) provides assertion toolkit.
- Package [check](pkg/check) provides equality toolkit used by `assert` package.
- Package [dump](pkg/dump) provides configurable renderer of any type to a string.
- Package [must](pkg/must) provides basic test helpers which panic on error.
- Package [notice](pkg/notice) helps to create nicely formated assertion messages.
- Package [tester](pkg/tester) provides facilities to test `Test Helpers`.

Click on the package link to see its README.md file with documentation. Each 
also package has an `examples_test.go` file with usage examples.
